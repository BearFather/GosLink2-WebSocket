Welcome to my simple sample web page for GosLink2 websocket.  If you have any questions email me at BearFather@gmail.com.

To config:
Start by creating a DB and table for gosbot on a MySQL server. The table needs no auto increment. "id int(11), user varchar(25), msg, varchar(128), trgt varchar(25)"
edit output.php, change the variables to your server info.
edit input.php, change the variables to your server info.
Launch webpage, sit back and profit the inet gold!


NOTE:  Most public webservers block non http ports, so you might have to connect your provider to allow port 3000 to you mud server.
